<h2>
Here are few incridible dishes one must try if visit in Nagpur!
</h2>

<h3>While Nagpur doesn’t usually feature among the country’s culinary hotspots, the truth is the city’s gastronomic offerings will bowl you over.

From the unique and explosive Saoji cuisine to delicious street food, daal that enjoys a cult status and smoking hot kebabs and giant handis of
 Biryani – Nagpur will leave you spoilt for choice.

Here are a few food stops you must make on your visit to the city.</h3>


<h3>TARRI POHA</h3>
  <img src="images/TariPohaNagpur.jpg" alt="MumbaiFood.html" style="width:580px;height:260px;"><br>
  This is the archetypal Nagpuri breakfast but you can savour a plate of delicious poha (a spicy pilaf of sorts made with soaked flattened rice) with spicy curried black gram or chickpeas, with the tarri on the side, anytime of the day.

The dish is best had by pouring the tarri on the poha, topping it up with finely chopped onions and finishing with a squeeze of lime.
 There are numerous roadside shacks across the city, (what locals refer to as ‘tapri’), which serve tarri poha. 
 If you want to sample one the best renditions of the dish, head to Deo Nagar to sample the legendary Keshav poha tarri 
 (they open for an hour and a half around six in the morning) or head to Rupam Sakhare’s stall in Kasturchand Park; 
his aloo poha topped with spicy tarri will blow your mind.<br><br><br><br>
  
  
  
<h3>PARAM KI DAAL</h3>  
  <img src="images/misalpavbedekar.jpg" alt="MumbaiFood.html" style="width:580px;height:260px;"><br>
  No trip to Nagpur is complete without having tasted Param ki daal, where Param has been dishing out the legendary dal from the
  same spot in Itwari for decades now.  It is difficult to spot this innocuous eatery with shabby interiors and throngs of hungry people
  but anyone and everyone will easily direct you to it.

The luscious daal cooked on a charcoal fire (hence, the delicious smoky flavour) is served with soft tandoori roti and makes for a simple but delicious meal. 
They also make this quirky fried rice in browned butter that’s worth a try.<br><br><br><br>
  
  
  
  <h3>SAMOSA</h3>
  <img src="images/samosa.jpg" alt="MumbaiFood.html" style="width:580px;height:260px;"><br>
  When it comes to Nagpur’s favourite street snack the samosa is likely to feature right at the top. Samosas, of course, 
  are ubiquitous in this country but try the Nagpuri samosa especially for the delicious assortment of condiments that typically
  accompany the humble potato-stuffed fried pastry.  At Priti Corner in Shankar Nagar Square, the samosa is a veritable crowd-puller 
  and has often been dubbed as the best in city.

The samosas at this four-decade-old eatery come crumbled and topped with dry curried chickpeas, tangy tamarind chutney and a 
sprinkle of finely chopped fresh coriander (you could opt for yogurt too). While here, also try their Ragda patties, their other bestseller.
 Or try the Chhola Samosa at Samosawala near Nagpur’s famous Bada Hanuman temple.<br><br><br><br>
