About Beaches in Maharashtra

Maharashtra,
one of the most prosperous and largest states of India is located on the west coast
 of India facing the Arabian Sea to the west. With a long coastline, Maharashtra is
 blessed with hundreds of beaches that are extremely beautiful and great for tourists.
 These beaches of Maharashtra are famous for their serene vibe and scenic beauty 
 as compared to their Goan counterpart in the South. Lined along the Konkan Coast,
 these delightful beaches offer respite to city dwellers in Maharashtra looking for 
 the serenity found by the ocean. While the beaches in Mumbai are not as good anymore
 because of immense urbanization and lots of tourist crowd, the beaches in the other parts 
 of Maharashtra are pristine and almost undisturbed by the tourists. 
 Among the offbeat beaches in Maharashtra, Kashid, Tarkarli, Harihareshwar and Ganpatipule 
 are among the best. Alibaug is an extremely popular beach destination among the tourists 
 from Mumbai and Pune.
 Beaches in Maharashtra that you must visit.
