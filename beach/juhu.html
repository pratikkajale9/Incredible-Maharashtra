<p>
<h4>
Juhu beach is the longest beach in Mumbai and the most popular among tourists as well. It is renowned for its wide variety of street food that has a typical Mumbai flavour and is sweet and sour. The surrounding area of Juhu is one of the poshest localities in Mumbai and is home to a lot of famous Bollywood and TV celebrities - the most famous being Amitabh Bachchan's bungalow - and it is not rare to spot a celebrity jogging on the beach.

Television shoots are often held and a number of toy-sellers, roasted corn vendors and acrobats attract the eye. While here, you may also visit the iconic ISKCON Temple which is meters away from the beach or watch a theatre performance at the famous Prithvi Cafe. Just taking walk across the beach sand can bring an infinite sense of calm. Although the beach was criticized for being unclean, efforts by BMC have significantly improved the scenery in the past few years.
