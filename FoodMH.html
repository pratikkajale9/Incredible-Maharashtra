Food in Maharashtra 
</h1>
<p class="p1">

Maharashtrian or Marathi cuisine is the cuisine of the Marathi people from the Indian state of Maharashtra. 
It has distinctive attributes, while sharing much with other Indian cuisines. 
Traditionally, Maharashtrians have considered their food to be more austere than others.

Maharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes. Wheat, rice, jowar, bajri, vegetables, lentils and fruit are dietary staples. 
Peanuts and cashews are often served with vegetables. Meat was traditionally used sparsely until recently, 
because of culture.

The urban population in metropolitan cities such as Mumbai, Pune and others has been influenced by cuisine from other parts of India and abroad. 
For example, the Udupi dishes idli and dosa, as well as Chinese and Western dishes, are quite popular in home cooking, and in restaurants.

Distinctly Maharashtrian dishes include ukdiche modak, aluchi patal bhaji and Thalipeeth.<br><br>


From the world-famous pav bhaji to the delicious poha, Maharashtra has a lot to offer to food lovers. 
Maharashtrian cuisine can be broadly classified into two styles- Konkan and Varadi. 
Konkan being from the coastal region has influences from Goan, Saraswat, Gaud and Malvani regions.<br>
Varadi cuisine, on the other hand, belongs to the Vidarbha region.
Some spices like Goda Masala, Kokum, Tamarind and Coconut are essential ingredients in the Maharashtrian kitchen.
Maharashtrian cuisine is considered to be very diverse as the flavours and spice levels differ in different parts of the state.<br>
